### Reframing Accessibility for the Web - by Anne Gibson

### From AbilityNet

- It’s the law – enshrined in the Disability Equality Act (2010).  If your website does not meet certain design standards, then you could be sued for discrimination.
- There’s a compelling business case – the UK’s 12 million disabled people have a spending power of £120 billion. Are you losing out on this potentially lucrative market?
- Accessible websites are 35% more usable by all users - whether they have special access needs or not. 
- Accessible websites are cheaper to run and maintain – they simply make good business sense.

### Stats on UK population not being able to access government digital services

> Borner’s struggle is far from unusual. The Department of Work and Pension’s (DWP) own survey data suggests 46% of people claiming universal credit need help applying online. The same data shows that a quarter of applicants who fail to submit their claims online put it down to difficulties accessing computers or the internet.
> 
> The government expects people to make and manage their claims online, but last year the UN’s rapporteur on extreme poverty, Philip Alston, noted that just over half of people on low incomes in the UK do not have home broadband and 21% of the entire population do not have basic digital skills. Alston said the digital-by-default design of the universal credit system may be contributing to the third of claims never reaching payment, and accused ministers of putting up digital barriers “that effectively obstruct many individuals’ access to their entitlements”.

### Website Accessibility and Buying Power of Persons with Disabilities – Karl Groves (2011)

[According to the Census Bureau (PDF)](https://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-17.pdf) 3.6% of the US Population have a sensory disability (hearing or visual), 8.2% have a mobility impairment, 4.8% have a cognitive disorder.  You can say that those with a sensory disability will definitely require an accessible website.  You can also say that a substantial portion of those with mobility and cognitive disabilities will require an accessible website.  I therefore give an estimate of 7-10% of potential customers have a direct need for an accessible website.

### 10 web accessibility myths debunked – User Zoom

The [Global Economics of Disability Annual Report 2016](http://www.rod-group.com/sites/default/files/2016%20Annual%20Report%20-%20The%20Global%20Economics%20of%20Disability.pdf) estimated the global population of people with disabilities (PWD)) as 1.3 billion: a market equivalent in size to the population of China.

 ... | Global | USA | Canada | EU | Asia 
 --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
 PWD Population | 1.31B | 57mm | 6.2mm | 91.0mm | 748mm

Population and income data for people with disabilities and their friends and family, courtesy of Return on Disability.

This works out to more than 17% of the world’s population – with a combined annual disposable income, according to the report, of more than $8 trillion. I think you’ll agree that these aren’t small amounts.

On top of this, one of the largest demographics – the so-called ‘Baby Boomer’ generation – is rapidly adding to this number. If you have a business that caters to older users in any way, you need to bear accessibility considerations in mind. And even if you don’t, a larger percentage of your potential customer base than you might realise will benefit from you making your website accessible.

### Investigating MobileAccessibility Guidance for People with Aphasia – City University 2018

The World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) have become  widely accepted  as  the  standard  for  web  accessibility  evaluation. This  poster  investigates  how  the  mobile  version  of  these guidelines   caters   for   people   with   aphasia   (PWA)   by comparing  the  results  from  user  testing  against  that  of  an audit  using  the  guidelines.

Only  13.7%  of  the  total  usability  issues  encountered  by participants could be mapped to the accessibility guidelines.  They   were  mapped   to  5   different   guidelines   from   the accessibility  audit.  The  remaining  63  (86.3%)  usability issues  could  not  be  mapped  to  any  guideline  from  the accessibility audit.

### Equivalent Experiences: What Are They? – Eric Bailey, Smashing Magazine

We’ve covered actual people’s everyday frustrations, as well as civil rights and the current legal landscape. If these don’t motivate you, allow me to present another factor to consider: profit.

There are two provoking studies I’d like to call attention to, but they are by no means the only studies performed in this space.

First is the [Click Away Pound Survey](http://clickawaypound.com/), a survey conducted in both 2016 and 2019 to “explore the online shopping experience of people with disabilities and examine the cost to business of ignoring disabled shoppers.”

The survey discovered that more than 4 million people abandoned a retail website because of the access barriers they found. These people represent 17.1 billion pounds (~$21.1 billion USD) in lost potential revenue.

Second is the [The Purchasing Power of Working-Age Adults With Disabilities (PDF)](https://www.air.org/system/files/downloads/report/Hidden-Market-Spending-Power-of-People-with-Disabilities-April-2018.pdf), conducted in 2018 by the American Institutes for Research. This study discovered that there is an estimated $490 billion in disposable income amongst disabled working-age adults. That’s billion with a capital B.

### Minimizing code defects to improve software quality and lower development costs – IBM 2008, and The Exponential Cost of Fixing Bugs, NIST

There are many studies that show the changes in the cost of fixing defects at different stages of the development process. Based on the cost of fixing a defect at the design stage as having a factor of 1x, these [studies show cost differences](ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/software/rational/info/do-more/RAW14109USEN.pdf) that increase to 6x during implementation, 15x during testing after code commit, and as high as 100x if caught after the defect makes it into production. [Research by the NIST](https://deepsource.io/blog/exponential-cost-of-fixing-bugs/) estimates the defects fixing costs being as 10x during integration testing and 15x during system testing but only 30x in production.[^2] Regardless of what your organization’s actual costs are, one thing is certain: catching defects in the design and development phase is orders-of-magnitude less expensive than later in the process.

### Being inaccessible is a choice – Gareth Ford-Williams

For starters, being “inaccessible” is a choice. Nothing starts out as inaccessible until people make design and technical decisions. Every poor decisions filters more and more people out…

## 2. About the cost of accessibility

### Cost of making things accessible late

<figure>

    Compared to catching a defect in development, catching it in Build is 3x higher, catching it in QA is 12 higher, catching it in maintenance is 95x higher.

### Website Accessibility and Reduced Design, Development, Production, Maintenance Costs – Karl Groves (2011)

> In terms of _new_ development, I don’t see any difference in terms of development time for something inaccessible vs. something accessible (provided the developer understands accessibility).  I generally consider the level of effort to be identical for new development. Additionally, although it could be argued that some reduced maintenance time could be realized, the business always has option to not fix issues that are not related to display and operability, leaving other issues alone.

### How Expensive is Web Accessibility? – Karl Groves (2011)

### Question to Glenda Sims

#### My question

Hello Glenda, I’m an UX designer/developer learning as much as I can about accessibility – and how to encourage my company to invest in it.

I was just reading your great blog post from 2011 “Design with Accessibility in Mind”.

In it, one of the things you say is that:

``` 
Accessibility experts estimate that the cost of developing sites that meet WCAG 2.0 AA increases development costs by the following:
1% to 3% on simple sites built with html and css (and little to no javascript)
3% to 6% on intermediate sites built with html, css and an intermediate level of javascript
6% to 10% on heavy javascript sites or flash sites
```

I’ve been looking for some stats like this, about the incremental cost of accessibility if it’s bake it throughout the process (rather than done at the end). So I’m very interested in this stat.

I wondered whether you could remember the source for this stat? Or you could think of any other source/stats about this?

Thanks a lot,
Jean-Francois

#### Glenda's answer

HI Jean-Francois, those stats were from my experience as a lead developer at UT Austin.

Also use data for cost of fixing bugs later in the SDLC data…like you find in this article https://crossbrowsertesting.com/blog/development/software-bug-cost/
